# What This Is

This repository contains some examples of using Oizumi et al. `phi_toolbox` in 
Matlab and Albantakis et al. `pyphi` in Python to calculate Phi values for
Integrated Information Theory. 

The examples are written using Jupyter Notebooks.

The data is not included in this repository. If you wish to run the notebooks again, the data should be stored under a `data/` directory and the filenames in the notebook should be changed to the data filenames.
